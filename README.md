# Image-Mosaic
* This is a little project to reconstruct a color image with a set of images. 
* In the example notebook, I used [cifar-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) as the dataset. You can use your own images.
* The underlying theory is to replace the pixel patches with the iamges from the dataset who possess the closest color intensities.

###  The example result is below. You can adjust the size of patches to be replaced.
* Input image:
